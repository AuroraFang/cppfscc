# FSCC C++ Library (cppfscc)
This README file is best viewed [online](http://github.com/commtech/cppfscc/).

## Installing Library

##### Downloading Library
- You can use the pre-built library files that are included with the driver
- Or, you can download the latest library version from
[Github releases](https://github.com/commtech/cppfscc/releases).


## Quick Start Guide

Lets get started with a quick programming example for fun.

_This tutorial has already been set up for you at_ [`examples/tutorial.cpp`](examples/tutorial.cpp).

First, drop `cppfscc.dll`, `cppfscc.lib` and `cfscc.dll` into a test directory. Now that those files are copied over, create a new C++ file (named tutorial.cpp) with the following code.

```c++
#include <iostream> /* cout, endl */
#include <cstdlib> /* EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE */
#include <fscc.hpp> /* fscc_connect, fscc_disconnect, fscc_handle
                       fscc_write, fscc_read */

int main(void)
{
    Fscc::Port p(0);

    // Send "Hello world!" text
    p.Write("Hello world!");

    // Read the data back in (with our loopback connector)
    std::cout << p.Read() << std::endl;

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

For this example I will use the Visual Studio command line compiler, but you can use your compiler of choice.

```
# cl /EHsc tutorial.cpp cppfscc.lib /I <CPPFSCC_DIR>\src
```

Now attach the included loopback connector.

```
# tutorial.exe
Hello world!
```

You have now transmitted and received an HDLC frame!

## Visual Studio Integration
The process for using the library will differ slightly depending on the version of Visual Studio.

1. Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories: (folder containing fscc.hpp)
2. Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories: (folder containing cppfscc{d}.lib)
3. Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies: cppfscc{d}.lib
4. Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Environment: PATH=%PATH%;(folder containing cppfscc{d}.dll)


## Build Dependencies
- C++ compiler (G++ & Visual Studio tested)
- [cfscc](https://github.com/commtech/cfscc/) (Included)


## Run-time Dependencies
- OS: Windows XP+ & Linux
